# EngSci_2.1_Abridged
EngSci Season 2.1 (second year first semester) abridged. This repository currently holds notes for ECE253 and AER210.

**HOW TO USE**: If you just want notes, then go to the `/pdf` folder and they're all there.

## Document Structure:
* `/pdf`: This folder ONLY contains PDF files for the most recent versions of the notes for every class. 
* `classList.txt`: Simple text list of the classes, used when automatically rendering all `.tex` files into PDF's.
* `/tex`: Folder that holds all `.tex` files and logs and aux files for every class's notes.
   - `export.sh`: a script that renders all of the `.tex` files.

## Dependencies:
If you want to play with the `.tex` files and render them on your computer, you need `pdflatex` and `latex` installed. The `export.sh` script also only will work on a unix-based computer.
